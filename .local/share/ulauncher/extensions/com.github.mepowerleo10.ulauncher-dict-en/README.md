# ulauncher-dict-en

A [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) extension for looking up dictionary definitions of English words.

The dictionary file is generated from http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ralph/OPTED/.

**NOTE:** I will not be developing this extension any further as I no longer use Ulauncher. Feel free to fork this repo if there are changes you'd like to see implemented.

## Demo

## Installation

Open ulauncher, go to `Preferences > Extensions > Add extension` and
paste the project's URL: `https://github.com/katacarbix/ulauncher-dict-en`.

## Usage

Type the keyword (`def` by default) followed by all or part of the word you want to look up. Pressing `Enter` brings up the Wiktionary page for the highlighted word in your default browser.

## To do

- Fix display of verb tense entries. Currently the word appears blank. Definition reads "of [word]" instead of "... tense of [word]".
