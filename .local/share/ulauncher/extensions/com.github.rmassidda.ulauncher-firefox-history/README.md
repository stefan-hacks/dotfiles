The search results can be **aggregated by hostname**, so that visiting _twitter.com/UlauncherApp_ and _twitter.com/github_ generates _twitter.com_ as result.

The **number of results** and the **popularity criteria** can be changed in the extension's settings. The popularity can be determined by last visit date, visit count or [Firefox Frecency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Frecency_algorithm) heuristic.
